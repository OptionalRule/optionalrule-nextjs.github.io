# Scott Turnbull's writing style

Throughout his blog is characterized by a **direct, practical, and conversational tone**, consistently aiming to provide **actionable advice and insightful analysis** for Dungeon Masters and players of tabletop roleplaying games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.

Key aspects of his writing style include:

* **Direct and Engaging Address**: Turnbull frequently addresses the reader directly, fostering a sense of shared community and collaboration. Phrases like "I hope you'll get some use out of this for your game too", "Now get out there and run some great games", and "Drop me a DM on twitter if you have any trouble" invite interaction and reinforce his role as a helpful guide.

* **Clear and Structured Presentation**: His posts are consistently well-organized with **prominent headings and subheadings**, often utilizing **bullet points and numbered lists** to break down complex information into easily digestible segments. This enhances readability and allows readers to quickly grasp key concepts.

* **Problem/Solution Orientation**: Many articles identify a common challenge or perceived weakness within D&D mechanics or community discussions and then propose "remixes," house rules, or alternative approaches as solutions. He often explains the *rationale* behind his proposed changes, focusing on how they can improve gameplay, pacing, or player engagement.

* **Analytical and Data-Backed Where Appropriate**: When discussing game mechanics, balance, or statistical outcomes, Turnbull often incorporates **data analysis, simulations, and charts** to support his arguments. This provides a strong, evidence-based foundation for his advice (e.g., "The Math" and "The Simulation" sections for Great Weapon Fighter damage, "Language by Stat Block Count", "5e Spell Saves by Class").

* **Opinionated Yet Collaborative**: He doesn't shy away from expressing strong opinions or personal preferences (e.g., "There is no surprise round in 5e D&D and we need to stop using that term", "No, racism is not required in a fantasy world"), but he consistently invites readers to share their own thoughts and experiences via social media, fostering a sense of ongoing dialogue and community input.

* **Emphasis on "Fun" and Collaborative Play**: A foundational element of his philosophy is that games should be **fun and foster a sense of shared experience**. He often frames rules and advice through this lens, advocating for player agency, varied playstyles, and supportive group dynamics. He explicitly states that "funâ€¦ is not optional".

* **Historical and Contextual Awareness**: Turnbull frequently provides **historical context** for D&D mechanics, design choices, or community discussions, drawing on the game's evolution from its wargaming roots to its current state. This enriches his explanations and provides a deeper understanding of the topics he addresses.

* **Integration of External Resources**: He extensively references and links to other valuable resources, including other blogs, tools, official D&D books, and community discussions. This demonstrates a broad engagement with the TTRPG community and a willingness to draw on diverse perspectives.

* **Visual Support**: Almost every article includes **relevant images, such as battlemaps, character art, or explanatory diagrams**, which enhance the reader's understanding and engagement. These visuals are always captioned and often credited.
