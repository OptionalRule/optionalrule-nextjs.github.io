**Optional Rule Games** is a small self publisher dedicated to building flexible content that enables actual play in a fun and exciting way for Players and Game Masters alike.

![That's my face!](/images/optionalrule_lazydm.jpg)

I post game content for use with various Tabletop RPG systems, primarily 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. I hope you&#8217;ll find some of it interesting or useful and get out there and run games of your own. I&#8217;ve been playing Tabletop RPGs for almost 40 years and have no intention of stopping now. Currently I&#8217;m running a lot of 5th Edition D&D, but I enjoy and have created content for a number of systems in the past. Other TTRPGs I greatly enjoy are Burning Wheel, Traveller, Stars Without Number, Blades in the Dark, Vampire the Masquerade, Fate, Dungeon World, Harn, Cyberpunk, Call of Cthulhu, Shadowrun, and many more. 

Always remember, _the only thing that isn&#8217;t optional &#8230; is fun._
