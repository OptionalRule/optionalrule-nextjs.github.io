Three hundred years ago the Lady of the Terrible Dawn killed the gods and broke their throne. She does not rule from a palace. She wanders the shattered realm where the gods were banished. In the world she left behind, five Sorcerer Kings swear to her and keep a tense peace. They are powerful, androgynous, and never fully honest. They avoid open war because the Lady forbids it. Skirmishes, plots, and dirty jobs are common.
      
You play a company of seasoned mercenaries. You take contracts. You survive. You write your own honor code and try to keep it.

## The Sorcerer Kings at a glance

**The Starspawn**
Masked with a single star on the brow. Patron of oaths, navigators, and secret police. Their magic binds promises. Break a deal and the night sky changes to mark your failure. They can strike a person from fate by erasing the star that bears their name.

**The Demon Knight**
Immaculate armor, voice like a coin flip. Collector of promises. They taste a true name in blood and claim the body that carries it. Serves order, taxes, and fear. Their mark is hidden inside the mouth and burns when a debt comes due.

**The Voidwalker**
Silver and shadow. Master of distance. They shorten roads, stretch borders, and fold streets. Point at a fortress and the space between finger and wall goes missing. Courier temples honor them with silent drums.

**The Rahkshasa**
Painted whiskers, rings on every finger. Sovereign of masks, memory, and dreams. They hunt in sleep, leave claw marks in recollection, and keep nine sacred vows. Eight are said to be spent. The ninth will change a city or a saint.

**The Scavenger**
Cloak of stitched pelts, crown of bent nails. Builder of engines and carrion legions. They pull stories from bones and make the bones believe. Roads near their workshops smell like hot oil and graves after rain.

## The map is a jigsaw

Borders lie. Each King holds core lands, yet their influence bleeds everywhere.

* Starspawn lantern guilds run census and oath registries in rival capitals.
* Demon Knight tollhouses sit on rivers that feed the Scavenger’s foundries.
* Voidwalker shrines stand in every market since distance is wealth.
* The Rahkshasa’s maze quarter, Vellic Court, shifts by the hour and hosts spies from all sides.

Princes wear reversible cloaks. Merchants swap banners at checkpoints. Court climbers rise fast, then vanish when a new anthem plays.

## Your place in it

You are the tool every faction uses when they cannot show their own hand. You escort ledgers that can topple a barony. You steal people rather than jewels. You burn or rescue songs that change memory. You choose which orders you follow and which you twist.

Guiding tone: steel is honest, people are not. Get paid. Live to see tomorrow. Keep a line you will not cross, then hope you never meet the job that tests it.

## Work you can expect

* **Escort and Extraction**: Move a witness, a relic, or a cursed ledger across three borders.
* **Countermagic**: Disrupt a vow, mute a drumline, or lengthen a road the Voidwalker shortened.
* **Dirty Diplomacy**: Trade one secret for three favors and walk away before the bill comes due.
* **Asset Denial**: Sabotage a carrion engine or mislead an oath registry without leaving proof.
* **Annals and Aftermath**: Record what really happened. Hide it from the wrong eyes.

## Starting jobs

1. **Star-Tax on the Night River**
   A constellation ledger fell from the Starspawn’s bazaar before sunset. The Demon Knight’s collectors tasted its ink and want it. The Scavenger wants to melt it into an engine core. Your employer wants it unread and unbroken. Pick a side, then get off the water alive.

2. **Two Steps Nearer**
   The Voidwalker shortened the road between two border towns. Trade spiked, famine followed, smugglers thrive. Restore the old distance or learn who paid to bend the world. Expect tollhouses, desperate farmers, and a drum that silences echoes.

3. **Nine Vows, One Mask**
   A Rahkshasa mask forces truth for a day, then its wearer vanishes. Track the mask, break the cycle, and try to finish without lying. Someone will beg you to make an exception.

4. **Foxfire Engine**
   The Scavenger’s new machine runs on war stories. Every tale fed to it becomes real for an hour. Steal the heart of the engine or convince it that peace is the better story. The workshop is made of bones and copper.

5. **Parade of a Second Dawn**
   Omens say the Lady will cross the Banished Stair at midsummer. All five Kings plan a joint procession. Guard it. Ruin it. Vanish inside it with the one person who claims to know why she walks.

## Places that matter

* **Constellium Bazaar**: Glass roofs, sky-lit prices, contracts weighed like grain.
* **Night River**: Floating markets and bridges that change owners by dinner.
* **Carrion Causeway**: Road of fused bones that sings when it rains.
* **Vellic Court**: The Rahkshasa’s shifting quarter. Bring chalk. Mark your turns.
* **Airless Steps**: Stairs to nowhere used by Voidwalker messengers. Tie a cord to your wrist if you do not know the path.

## Table talk for the road

* The Starspawn’s favorite courtesan is a living city map written in freckles.
* The Demon Knight’s mint uses teeth from one bloodline only. Guess which.
* The Voidwalker keeps a silent child who counts to hold the world together. When the counting stops, mountains move.
* The Rahkshasa is down to the last vow. Everyone wants to decide what it breaks.
* The Scavenger’s throne ticks like a clock. When it stops, a hundred hearts will stop with it.

Pick a banner or keep your own. Either way the morning comes. Sharpen steel. Choose a job. March.
