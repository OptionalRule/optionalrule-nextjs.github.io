I created this map for a custom scenario in my Rime of the Frostmaiden Campaign using [DungeonDraft](https://dungeondraft.net/).

In my scenario, the players faced a cult of Barbarians who were seeking magic items from the ancient tomb of one of the original Horizon Walkers.  A group were guarding the entrance, while the main group camped out in the first chamber.  The leaders were back toward the secret entrance to the tomb.
