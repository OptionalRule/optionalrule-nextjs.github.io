Early D&D treated light as an important element of dungeon exploration.  It bounded the players world into a very tight space, where untold horrors lurked just beyond the edge of their light. Since hitpoints, potions, and other resources were scarce, managing light made the danger of what lurked in that darkness feel real. It was a vital part of building tension and atmosphere in early games and establishing the feeling of exploring a dangerous, unknown place. Most character races did not have darkvision, in fact darkvision didn't even exist and it was divided into low light vision that only worked outside, and infravision that only worked in the dark.

Contributing to the sense of danger and uncertainty, light was a resource that could be lost or stolen, Players had to be careful about how they used it as it could easily alert monsters to their presence. Light sources were treated like an important resources like rope, rations, and hit points. You tracked it, protected it, and planned around it. Infravision was finicky heat-sense, not a free flashlight, so even stout dwarves needed flame to read a map or notice a tripwire. Low-light vision only worked outside and the rest of the party was literally "left in the dark".

The edge of the torch defined the edge of the world. That circle shrank with every turn.

Modern tables often skip that pressure. 5e hands out darkvision widely and many groups run it as “see normally, in gray.” The rules do not support that shortcut, but most tables can't be bothered with the distinction and they are leaving a key tool of creating in game tension "on the table".  That being said, it's fair to say that the rules-as-written in 5e water down the fear of the dark.This takes that night, which should be dark and full of dangers, and makes it a minor annoyance at best.

We're losing something important when we treat light as a non-issue. This article offers a toolkit to make light matter again. You can pick and choose from these ten options to fit your table's style. The goal is to make light a resource that shapes exploration, forces choices, and makes the dungeon feel actively hostile when the party's lights go out. OSR and OSR-adjacent games have leaned into this for decades. 5e can too, with a few tweaks and a little bookkeeping. I think a small bit of resource tracking can be a good thing, but it has to mean something. Watching a resource dwindle should raise some level of anxiety and tension, and players should even occasionally have to make hard choices about how to manage it.

This is key to engaging players, and making them feel like their choices matter and giving them more agency. If they can just ignore the dark, then it becomes a non-issue, and the game loses a lot of its tension and excitement.

## The Shadowdark Reminder

Shadowdark RPG packages that energy and excitement from the past for modern play. No one starts with darkvision. Light is finite. All light sources last a real world hour. When the party’s lights go out, encounter pressure spikes and the dungeon becomes actively hostile. Many foes see in the dark. That asymmetry flips a lantern into a beacon and makes decisions around light feel meaningful again. If you want a concise look at why this works, start here: [Shadowdark RPG](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark-rpg). For a spicy refresher on vision rules at the table, Angry GM’s piece is worth every minute: [Ask Angry: Seeing in the Dark](https://theangrygm.com/ask-angry-seeing-in-the-dark/).

Shadowdark didn't invent these ideas. Starting with a deep appreciation for the kind of exiting adventures created by early D&D, it repackaged them for a new audience. You can use this to spice things up again in your 5e games as well.

## A Practical Toolkit for 5e

You do not need to switch systems. You only need to make light matter. The following tools work together. Pick three and commit to them for a full dungeon, then add more once your table sees the difference.

### 1) Enforce the rules that already exist

* Call out lighting states on the map. Bright, dim, or dark. Say them out loud when players cross a threshold.
* Apply the consequences. Dim light worsens sight-based Perception. Darkness blinds creatures without help. Creatures attacking a blinded target have advantage, and the blinded creature attacks at disadvantage.
* Keep darkvision limited. It turns darkness into dim light within its radius, which still imposes those Perception penalties. It does not grant color, depth, or detail suitable for reading, tracking faint stains, or spotting hairline cracks. When players say “I have darkvision so I see fine,” answer with “You see shapes and movement, not ink color or etched glyphs.”

### 2) Put time back on the table

* Choose a simple clock. A torch is one hour or six ten-minute turns. A hooded lantern is six turns per flask of oil.
* Charge time for meaningful actions. Moving to a new area, mapping, searching carefully, forcing a stuck door, or looting a room consumes a turn. State the new time and remaining light.
* Tie risk to time. Roll a 1 on a d6 for a wandering check each turn. Mention rising drafts and spoor as the clock runs down to invite informed choices.

### 3) Let the dungeon fight the flame

* Telegraph risk. “The tunnel breathes with a steady draft. Your torch gutters.” “Soot trails rise to a narrow chimney.”
* Aim attacks and hazards at the light. Goblins carry sloshing buckets. Bats swarm toward flame. A trapped door exhales and threatens to snuff exposed torches unless covered.
* Make payoff concrete. A snuffed torch plunges the party into chaos for a round. Advantage flips, initiative gets messy, and even a few skeletons feel terrifying.

### 4) Design encounters that reward carrying light

* Color and contrast. Clues that depend on hue, paint, or faint stains cannot be read by darkvision.
* Fine detail. Runes with hairline breaks, tiny clockwork latches, and pressure plates with micro-gaps require bright light to spot.
* Darkvision traps. A stalker that is invisible to creatures relying on darkvision forces the party to pick a lane. They can operate by lantern or suffer ambush.

### 5) Rebalance darkvision without feeling punitive

Pick one of these variants and communicate it at session zero.

* **Low-light vision, not darkvision.** Ancestries that list darkvision instead treat dim light as bright. True darkness is still darkness.
* **Shortened range.** Cut darkvision to 30 feet for most ancestries. Reserve 60 feet for Underdark natives with sunlight sensitivity.
* **Grayscale with teeth.** Darkvision cannot read ink, distinguish pigments, or judge depth beyond rough shapes. Players will light up when it matters without you saying “no.”
* **Trade and drawback.** If a player insists on true darkvision, pair it with a meaningful cost such as sunlight sensitivity or disadvantage on Perception checks in bright light.

### 6) Diversify senses so the party feels special without free flashlights

Give ancestry features that sidestep darkness in flavorful ways without replacing light.

* Dwarves sense warmth changes through stone and can place fresh air shafts.
* Elves feel faint magical auras and detect disrupted plant growth.
* Halflings hear the smallest scrape at camp and gain advantage to wake on stealth approaches.
* Gnomes smell alchemical traces and can follow subtle metallic tangs.

These boons make different characters shine in the dark while keeping lanterns relevant.

### 7) Stock better light and plan to protect it

Players will invest if you make the options clear and concrete.

* **Torches.** Cheap, smoky, broad radius, vulnerable to drafts.
* **Hooded lanterns.** Oil hungry, but protected flame and adjustable beam.
* **Bullseye lanterns.** Long cone that pierces big spaces and makes scouting feel surgical.
* **Candles.** Weak radius but perfect for detailed work and puzzle reading.
* **Magical light with limits.** Light cantrip fixed to an object that can be covered. A stronger Light spell with a one-hour duration and a visible aura that attracts attention.

Encourage redundancy. Two lit sources give tactical options when one fails.

### 8) Use maps and space to make darkness do work

* Build rooms larger than a single light radius. Players should not know how big a place is on entry.
* Layer height. A 40-foot ceiling swallows torchlight. Wings and webs live up there.
* Shape sightlines. T-intersections and offset doors hide movement just outside the glow.
* Place “sound hooks.” Chain rattles, low breathing, dripping water, sand slithers. The ear becomes the scout.

### 9) Script simple behaviors for dark-native foes

You do not need complex stat blocks to make darkness lethal.

* **Cut the wick.** First action is to snuff, shove, or splash the light.
* **Bait and retreat.** Show a silhouette at the edge of dim light, then fall back to lure the carrier forward.
* **Circle and jab.** Attack those outside the bright radius, then withdraw out of sight.
* **Learn the glow.** Shift tactics once the party uses hooded lanterns or bullseyes, targeting the bearer with ready actions.

### 10) Make rulings that keep decisions sharp

* Lighting a fresh torch takes an action and a free hand. Relighting a dropped torch takes two actions and a spark.
* Covering or uncovering a hooded lantern is an object interaction if the hand is free.
* Dousing rain and underground rivers impose checks to keep flame. Failure costs a turn and a consumable.
* Mapping carefully doubles the time cost for an area. Rushing halves it but risks missing secret doors.

## Worked Example: One Hour That Feels Like Adventure

You brief the table. Each torch is one hour. Every new chamber, careful search, or forced door costs ten minutes. Each ten minutes triggers a 1-in-6 encounter check. Your players begin with three torches, a hooded lantern, and a bullseye.

* **Chamber 1.** Ten minutes to search. You note twenty minutes down. A draft flickers flame.
* **Hall.** Ten minutes to wedge a stuck portcullis. A 1 appears on your d6. The patter of feet in the dark. Goblins splash a bucket at the lantern bearer. The lantern sputters. The bullseye snaps on and pins a silhouette at the far arch.
* **Chamber 2.** The cleric pockets the bullseye to free a hand. Perception checks suffer in dim light. A color puzzle on the dais stalls the group until someone lights a candle to see the red vs. brown pigments. Another turn ticks.
* **Retreat.** Twenty minutes of light remain. The group decides to push one more room and then turn back. The choice feels tight and earned.

None of this required new subsystems. It needed a clock, lighting states, and pressure that speaks through fiction.

## Digital Helpers That Keep You in Flow

Bookkeeping is the only real barrier. A shared timer fixes that. Track each active light with a name, a remaining time, and whether it is lit. Show the countdown to everyone. Pause when the party takes a short breather. Advance by a turn when they search or force a door. When a light hits zero, announce it and remove the token. This tiny bit of UI keeps tension visible while you focus on sounds in the dark and claws on stone.

## House Rules You Can Drop In Today

Steal this card for your table rules section.

* We use bright, dim, and dark lighting consistently.
* Darkvision never grants color or fine detail and does not remove Perception penalties from dim light.
* Torches, lanterns, and Light effects are timed and tracked.
* Every ten minutes of exploration triggers a 1-in-6 encounter check.
* Monsters target light first when it makes sense.
* Some threats are invisible to creatures relying on darkvision.
* Lighting or relighting costs actions, free hands, and real consumables.
* Low-light vision replaces most racial darkvision unless noted.

State these up front and players will build kits, share light-bearing duties, and plan routes with time in mind.

## Closing Thoughts

Darkness is not backdrop. It is an active rival that eats time, warps space, and amplifies sound. When light is finite and vision is imperfect, exploration turns into a string of sharp decisions. That is the energy that made early dungeon delves electric. Bring it back by enforcing what 5e already says about light, by adding a simple clock, and by letting the dungeon fight for every lumen. Your players will start caring about lantern shutters, spare tapers, and the soft hiss of oil. They will also cheer louder when someone strikes a spark at the last possible second.

If you try one change from this article, try the clock. Give the party one honest hour of light and make the dungeon care. The rest of the magic follows.
