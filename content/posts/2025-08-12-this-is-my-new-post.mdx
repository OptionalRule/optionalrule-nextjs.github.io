# This is my new post

Welcome to your new blog post! This is a sample introduction that you can replace with your actual content.

## Getting Started with Content

Here's a guide on how to use various Markdown features in your posts:

### Links

You can create links in several ways:

- **External links**: [Visit Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- **Internal links**: [About page](/about)
- **Anchor links**: [Jump to conclusion](#conclusion)

### Images

Add images to your posts:

### Code Blocks

Inline code: `console.log('Hello World')`

Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

### Lists

**Unordered lists:**
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

**Ordered lists:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Emphasis

- **Bold text** for important information
- *Italic text* for emphasis
- ***Bold and italic*** for strong emphasis
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for removed content

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it to highlight important quotes or call attention to specific information.

### Tables

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Markdown | Full support | ✅ |
| Images | Supported | ✅ |
| Links | Internal & external | ✅ |
| Code | Syntax highlighting | ✅ |

### Headers

Use headers to organize your content:

# Main Title (H1)
## Section (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
#### Sub-subsection (H4)

## Conclusion

This is where you can wrap up your post with a summary or call to action.

Remember to:
- Replace this sample content with your actual content
- Update the frontmatter fields as needed
- Add appropriate tags for categorization
- Include relevant images in the `/public/images/` directory

Happy writing!
