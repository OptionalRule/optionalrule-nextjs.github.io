When I first sat down to write a guide about running TTRPGs with modern AI, I thought I’d take a quick detour into solo play for context. That detour turned into a rabbit hole.

I’d always known solo play was part of my own gaming life in the early ’80s—those long afternoons when you couldn’t get a group together and had nothing but dice, random tables, and imagination to keep you company. But what surprised me is just how far back solo TTRPGs go. They weren’t a side experiment or a modern invention. They were there at the very start of the hobby.

And when you think about it, that makes perfect sense. Before the internet, before Discord servers and Roll20, we had to wait until the next weekend to see our friends again. In the meantime, we tinkered. We used whatever books and games we had to keep the spark alive. Solo play became its own way of exploring the hobby, half practice, half experiment, and all fun.

## From Wargames to Dungeons (1970s)

Long before *Dungeons & Dragons* was cracking open dungeons with groups of adventurers, solo play was already in the DNA of tabletop games. Historical wargamers had whole traditions of solitaire play, complete with guides like Donald Featherstone’s *Solo Wargaming* in 1973. (Available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Donald-Featherstones-Solo-Wargaming-Curry/dp/1409260119) as a reprint from the editor.)

And when D\&D arrived in 1974, it didn’t take long for solo rules to appear. Gary Gygax himself published “Solo Dungeon Adventures” in *The Strategic Review* in 1975, a precursor to the random dungeon generator that would later appear in the AD\&D *Dungeon Master’s Guide*. Suddenly you could roll dice to build dungeons room by room, filling them with monsters, traps, or treasure as you explored.

Around the same time, Richard Bartle (later co-creator of the first MUD) released *The Solo Dungeon* (1977), a more guided crawl for Original D\&D. Between Gygax’s procedural tables and Bartle’s authored adventures, the two core paths of solo RPG design—randomly generated chaos and prewritten branching choices—were set in motion right from the start.

And then came *[Tunnels & Trolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_%26_Trolls)*. In 1976, Flying Buffalo released *[Buffalo Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_%26_Trolls#Solo_adventures)*, widely considered the first published solo RPG module. Structured in numbered paragraphs like a proto-Choose Your Own Adventure, it let you wander into absurd encounters with trolls, octopi, and yes, even a raging buffalo. Dozens more solo adventures followed, making solo RPGs a real market, not just a curiosity.

## My First Solo Adventures

For me, though, it wasn’t D\&D that opened the solo door. It was *[The Fantasy Trip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantasy_Trip)*.

I started with the *Melee* and *Wizard* microgames, small boxed sets that came with rules, maps, and enough material to keep a young gamer hooked. Then came the solo adventures like *Treasure of the Silver Dragon* and *Master of Amulets*. These were compact, branching-path modules you could play through on your own, somewhere between a tactical combat sim and a Choose Your Own Adventure novel.

I can still remember sitting with those booklets, dice in hand, playing out battles and strange encounters. It felt like cracking open a secret corner of the hobby—something personal, where I wasn’t just playing a character, I was playing with the game itself. That sense of tinkering, of experimenting with rules and outcomes, has a fun way to get a gaming fix while waiting to see friends.

## The Gamebook Boom (1980s)

Of course, by the late ’70s and early ’80s, solo RPG ideas exploded into the mainstream through the [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://www.cyoa.com/pages/history-of-cyoa) books. Millions of kids suddenly knew what it was like to step into the story as “you,” making decisions that changed the outcome.

Then came the *Fighting Fantasy* series from Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, layering dice-based combat and character sheets on top of branching stories. These were my generation’s entry point into roleplaying without a group, and they left a mark. TSR even published their own solo D\&D modules in the same style, knowing that by then, everyone understood the numbered-paragraph format.

## Oracles and the Solo Renaissance

For decades, solo games were built on prewritten paths. Fun, but finite. Then in the 2000s, a new approach flipped the table: the [Mythic Game Master Emulator](https://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-gme.html).

Instead of reading through a script, Mythic let you ask questions—“Is the door locked?” “Does the NPC betray me?”—and answer them with dice and probability. Add in random events and tables, and suddenly you weren’t following a path, you were co-creating an emergent story. That shift opened up solo play to *any* RPG system. Want to play Call of Cthulhu or D\&D solo? Mythic made it possible.

That innovation paved the way for the modern explosion of solo-first systems like *Ironsworn* and *Starforged*, procedural crawlers like *Four Against Darkness*, and journaling games like *Thousand Year Old Vampire*. Each takes a different slice of the solo experience—exploration, storytelling, self-reflection—and pushes it further than ever before.

## Why It Matters Today

Looking back, I see solo play less as a side alley of the hobby and more as a parallel tradition. It was there at the birth of RPGs, it gave us gamebooks, it shaped systems, and it’s now thriving thanks to digital tools and communities like [r/Solo\_Roleplaying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/).

For me, solo play was about keeping the magic alive when friends weren’t around. For others today, it’s a way to practice GMing, to explore a system deeply, or just to tell a story on their own terms.

And now, with AI tools entering the picture, I think we’re on the cusp of yet another chapter. But that’s a topic for the next post.  Look for my next post on how I've been using AI for solo play using the Solodark rules. I'll walk you through my setup, the advantage and disadvantages of using AI, and how you can setup your own AI-powered solo play sessions.
