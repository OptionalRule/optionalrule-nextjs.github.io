As a fun side project, I developed a version of the retro-classic game [Asteroids](/games/asteroids/) that you can play here on the site in your browser. You can also find it under the Games section of the site and future games will be added there too. Asteroids is absolutely one of my all-time favorite early arcade games, and I’m really enjoying having it live on the site. I hope you do as well!

Make sure to share your high score on [X](https://x.com/optionalrule)!

> **Note:** I like the state of the game but will plan on adding a few more features in the future.  So expect to see an alien ship or two in the future. Also, some options for extra lives too.  Because of the key controls it *only works on desktop*.

After porting the site over to **NextJS** from Jekyll, I’ve been planning to implement some TTRPG tools and other interactive content. This project also gave me a chance to dive deeper into the various **CLI coding tools** available today, and it turned out to be a great low-stakes experiment. Despite that, I’m really happy with how it came together and look forward to building other tools, maybe even a few mini-games, either to support your table or just for fun.

As an aside to any tool developer considering AI programming tools for TTRPG projects, we’re at an interesting point. It’s hard to give definitive advice. If you have a solid background in IT, you’ll likely find these tools very useful. Without that experience, though, they can be frustrating. It takes practice to describe what you want clearly and even more skill to guide the tools back on track once they drift. That said, it doesn’t take massive expertise, just some awareness and patience. So, if you’re curious, give it a try with your eyes open.

The bigger question is what tools are worth building in the age of AI. The sweet spot is creating something genuinely useful and interesting that isn’t easier to do just by asking ChatGPT. Personally, I do this because it’s fun, and I hope others get something out of it as well. Just a bit of reflection after the site conversion and this new feature.

So once again, I hope you’ll try the Asteroids game and post your high score! Tag me on X if you do!
