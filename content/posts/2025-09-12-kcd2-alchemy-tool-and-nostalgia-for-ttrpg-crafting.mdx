Enhance and edit this post announcing the new tool I'd developed on OptionalRule.com and reflections on game design.

I've put up a new tool on the site to view, filter, and search Alchemy Reciepies for the game Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.  As a hard core fan of history and gritty or "realistic" TTRPGs like Harn or Pendragon, KCD2 is the kind of game I particularly enjoy.  I'm diving back in with the release of the new Forge DLC and wanted a better experience with potion crafting so I created this tool. It also got me thinking about TTRPG Design how crafting is handled, so in the tradition of creating content nobody cares about, I thought I'd write a post about it.

# The KCD2 Alchemy Tool

First, a bit about the tool. This isn't just a simple potion list. What this does is present recipies explained better, and designed to give you the best brewing results along with some other data.  The recipies were created by Omicron and I parsed those into data file and added some information like base value.  I mostly built it for myself so I can click through the ingredients I have and easily reference what potions I can make, and get the best instructions on how to make them.  Kind of a digital version of the tome of knowlege.  

It has some other features like presenting optimized recipies when your skill is high enough to save time.  It also lets you save your view (locally) so you don't have to enter all that data again.  Anyway, I hope you find it useful.

## TTRPG Potion Nostalgia

Playing KCD2 makes me pine for a lot of the old school wonder I had in earlier TTRPGs.  In particular, the fun of the potion mini-game reminded me of the earliest edition of the AD&D DMG.  The back of that book included all sorts of references, including a reference on herbs and their effects. Appropos of a lot of early AD&D information, it was pretty much usless and had little, if any, in game use.  That didn't matter though because gaming then was a bit more of an imaginative experience and, unrealitic as the design was, most of use found our thoughts swirling around what a fantasy medieval world would be like. So "fluff" like the herb or potions lists was great fodder for sitting in your room and pouring through the DMG for the 100th time to discover something new or interesting.  

Of course, nostalgia isn't what it used to be and that fond memory is really more an artifact of having no internet and being bored.  Stil though, it did create space for the mind to wonder and I've retained some of the yearning to build that vision of TTRPGs in my mind.
